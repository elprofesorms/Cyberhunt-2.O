                15.The name is written on the note: One snowy night, Sherlock Holmes was in his house sitting by the fire. All of a sudden a snowball came crashing through his window and broke it. Holmes got up and looked out the window just in time to see 3 neighborhood kids who were brothers run around a corner.
                The next day Holmes got a note that read: “? Crimson. He broke your window.”
                Which of the 3 Crimson brothers should Sherlock Holmes question about the incident?(First name is the answer)
